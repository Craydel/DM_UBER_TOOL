General

[ ] Prefs file error handling
      If the file exists and there is a path, some check should be done to ensure the path is correct (else it errors out anyway).

      [ ] Dunegone Gen
            Look for specific image (fllorTile.bmp, for example)
            If not present, allow for cancel without crashing, re-request folder, whatever.

      [ ] Reader
            Less critical - it just refers to a list of files.  If non present, then there's nothing in the list

      [ ] Character Sheet default save location
            Not implimented - would be useful to specify location

[ ] Prefs file specification
      If the prefs file exists, but is incorrect, should allow us to choose a 
        new one without having to actually find/delete the current one
      We might need a global pref file for the DM Uber Tool to handle this sort of thing


[ ] All modules should be able to point to a single directory (i.e "Resources"), and look for 
    their required files within that structure (sub folder or whatever)
      Migrate all pref files to a global DM_UberTool variable that, once loaded for any module, will be used for all modules.
      Ties in with global prefs above



=====================================================================
Player Info Sheet:

  [ ] Change textboxes to masked text boxes where applicable - this will fix trying to validate a "character" vs an INT.
  [ ] 

=====================================================================
Dice Roller:

  [ ] btn Save: Save contents of results box(lbresults) to an array.

  [ ] btnRecall: Recall the contents of the saved array into the results box.

  [ ] Add the +/- MOD function to the dice roll

  [ ] format text in the listbox to show something to the effect of 
      D4 + 1 = 5
      D4 + 1 = 3
      D4 + 1 = 2
      ----------
      3D4 + 3 = 10

  [ ] NPC Character sheet button to open dice roller for that character's attacks/saves/etc

=====================================================================
Reader:

  [X] Anchor WebBrowser to form so that is resizes.
  [X] Preferences for Resources path
        NOTE - enhancements for later mentioned in General above


==============================================================
Dungeon Generator Module:

  Initial upload complete
  Features:
    Selectable dungeon generation size (based on width x heigth "cells" at pathWidth wide
    Editable dungeon (wall/door/floor placement)

  ToDo:
    [ ] Save/Load format

    [ ] Load/Save default location (see General above for preferences/resources locations)

    [ ] Traps in editor

    [ ] Traps in generator

    [ ] Items (chairs, tables, items, etc)
          Cosmetic, used for display to players when entering a room

    [ ] Tile set graphics for smaller tile size (icons not scaling well for tiny tile size viewing, 4px and 8px probably need work)
          Load paths for tile size sets
          Tiles for smaller sizes (graphic files)
          Naming convention for tile size set (nice to have, not critical)

    [ ] Castle Generation
          User-specified room additions, one room at a time based on selected door

    [ ] Cleanup drawing method
          Change to draw to memory Bitmap rather than redrawing the whole thing one cell at a time (minimal impact)

    [ ] Secondary display to show only rooms that players have seen
          track Rooms to flag as "Visible" or not to non-DM
          track trap floor tiles as Visible or not to non-DM
          Second window to view on second screen/monitor for players

    [ ] Multi-level Castles
          Castle style build from ground up, 
          Greatrooms stack (towers), 
          User-editing to place rooms inside other stories
          Multi-level view
          Apply to Castle only - all others are mish-mash of underground style coverns.
